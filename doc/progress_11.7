module HTML5 :: Cards Against Humanity

	def accomplished
		"All of the game design and logic has been thought out and planned. So far, we have most controllers implimented from scaffolding. 
		Most of the logic behind the models has been implimented, but needs some further testing. The landing page has been designed as
		well as the general layout of the website." 
	end

	def future
		"Finish implimenting the controllers, finish implimenting the models, and finish implimenting the views,
		possibly write extra CSS to make our website very pretty. Will also need to write client-side 
		JS to make the game interactive."
